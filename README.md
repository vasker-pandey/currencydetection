# currencydetection
The system  leverages advanced image processing and computer vision techniques, utilizing Python in  a Jupyter Notebook environment. Key techniques include feature extraction, comparison,  and matching algorithms such as ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), SSIM and  Contour Detection.

This project has been made using Jupyter Notebook and the contents or result might differ with changes to time. This project was made on 2023 so updated system or feature removed during the time passed may be subjected to failure while running. 

To run the project, download all the files and save it on desktop. With the help of jupyter notebook, run the controller.ipynb and upload the note. If you want to find the differences of the features in another currency, just read the report and replace the dataset with required note and their features. Also you need to change the scale and location of the feature to match properly or else the system will try to find only on designated areas.
